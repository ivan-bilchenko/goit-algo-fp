# Final Project: Algorithms & Data Structures

This repository contains solutions for the final project, covering data structures, sorting algorithms, recursion, graphs, and simulations.

## Tasks Overview

* **Task 1: Data Structures:** Implementation of reversal, sorting, and merging for singly linked lists.
* **Task 2: Recursion:** Visualization of the "Pythagoras Tree" fractal using `matplotlib`.
* **Task 3: Dijkstra’s Algorithm:** Shortest path finding in a weighted graph using a binary heap.
* **Task 4: Binary Heap Visualization:** Displaying the heap structure as a binary tree.
* **Task 5: Tree Traversal:** Visualizing DFS and BFS traversals with dynamic color gradients.
* **Task 6: Optimization:** Comparison of Greedy Algorithm and Dynamic Programming (Knapsack problem) for food selection.
* **Task 7: Monte Carlo Simulation:** Simulating dice rolls to analyze sum probabilities.
